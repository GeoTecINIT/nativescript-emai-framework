# nativescript-emai-framework

**This project is no longer under active development and has been superseded by the [AwarNS Framework](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/awarns-framework)**

The Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention Framework (EMA/I Framework) is a NativeScript-based application development framework specifically created for the development of EMA and EMI mental health apps. 

Given it shared many interesting features that are desirable for applications sensitive to the context of the phone, the initial plugin monolith has been completely modularized and grown, to become a full-fledged context-awareness framework: the [AwarNS Framework](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/awarns-framework). Development in the EMA/I Framework has stopped. Hence, all the development efforts are now put into the [AwarNS Framework](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/awarns-framework). This repository is kept for archiving purposes only.

## Acknowledgements

The development of this software framework was possible thanks to the Spanish Government. Concretely, the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (grant references FPU17/03832 and FPU19/05352), and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's programme: "Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad" (references RTI2018-099939-BI-00 and PID2020-120250RB-100) [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033].

This project is an open-sourced excerpt coming from [SyMptOMS](http://geotec.uji.es/projects/symptoms/) and SyMptOMS-ET projects at [Geotec](http://geotec.uji.es/). This framework has been extensively used and tested internally for many years in mobile mental health apps developed in the context of the SyMptOMS and SyMptOMS-ET projects.
